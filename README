First exercice done by the Geneva Coding Dojo

Write a program that computes the annual road tax (vehicle excise duty) charges for three types of vehicles:  vans, cars and motorcycles.
The road tax rate is calculated as follows for each type of vehicle:

Vans 
Light goods vehicles weighing less than 3500kg are charged at 165 GBP (British Pounds); otherwise they are charged at 190 GBP.

Cars 
All cars registered on or before 1 March 2001 are charged according to their engine size (in cc).  A car with an engine size of less than or equal to 1550cc is charged at 110 GBP; otherwise it is charged at 165 GBP.
If the date of car’s registration is after 1 March 2001, the annual road tax charge is calculated according to the CO2 emission of the vehicle.  The table below displays the different road tax charges for this criterion.
(Hint: see the API documentation for the Date and DateFormat class)

                              Petrol Car
CO2 Emission Figure (g/km)            12 months rate in GBP
-----------------------------        ------------------------
            Up to 100                         65.00    
            101 to 120                        75.00    
            121 – 150                        105.00  
            151 – 165                        125.00  
            166 – 185                        145.00  
            Over 185                         160.00

For the data-entry enthusiasts who only believe in entering real and precise data, there is a website (http://www.vcacarfueldata.org.uk/ved/index.asp ) that can calculate for you the real CO2 emission for different models of cars, but you don’t need this information.  Remember, this program is only meant to represent a model solution that works for this problem.

Motorcycles 

Motorcycles are charged according to their engine size (in cc).  The following table displays the list of road tax charges according to this criterion.

                             Motorcycles  
Motorcycles (with or without sidecar)      12 months rate in GBP   
-------------------------------        ------------------------------
            Not Over 150cc                         15.00    
            151cc - 400cc                          30.00    
            401cc - 600cc                          45.00    
            All other motorcycles                  60.00

Task
Create an invoicing system that will ask the user to input a vehicle’s
a)         Manufacturer name (e.g. Toyota)
b)         Model (e.g. Avensis)
c)         Date of registration (e.g. 17/12/2002)

Depending on the type of vehicle (van, car or motorcycle), the program should proceed to produce an invoice containing the above input details as well as the amount of road tax charge to be paid for that particular vehicle.
